    - '*':
        reason: >-
          Required for deepchecks, which validates our data. The vulnerability
          requires local access at the same time as code is being run. Since all
          users with local access to Ovartaci are already admins, this does not
          introduce any further vulnerability.

  SNYK-PYTHON-JUPYTERSERVER-5862882:
    - '*':
        reason: >-
          Required for deepchecks, which validates our data. The vulnerability
          could redirect a login to jupyter server (which we do not use) to an
          outside site (which would be blocked on Ovartaci). This does not
          introduce any further vulnerability.

  SNYK-PYTHON-JUPYTERSERVER-5862881:
    - '*':
        reason: >-
          Required for deepchecks, which validates our data. The vulnerability
          could expose data to other local users _on the same server_ when
          opening untrusted files via the "Open image in new tab." function in
          jupyter server, (which we do not use). Since all users with local
          access to Ovartaci are already admins, this does not introduce any
          further vulnerability.

        reason: >-
          If a user is logged in to the Jupyter Server (which we do not use),
          and an error occurs, other users can see the errors. At most, it will
          include where a particular file is stored, and therefore is not
          sensitive to us at all. Exception approved by email between Andreas,
          Martin and SÃ¸ren on 2023-12-07.

  SNYK-PYTHON-MLFLOW-6124044:
    - '*':
        reason: Vulnerability if streaming datasets from a web server, allowing them to write to a directory outside of the current directory. Streaming datasets from the web with mlflow is not allowed, and writing to a directory is a relatively minor vulnerability.
