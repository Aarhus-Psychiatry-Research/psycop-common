        reason: >-
          If a user is logged in to the Jupyter Server (which we do not use),
          and an error occurs, other users can see the errors. At most, it will
          include where a particular file is stored, and therefore is not
          sensitive to us at all. Exception approved by email between Andreas,
          Martin and SÃ¸ren on 2023-12-07.

  SNYK-PYTHON-MLFLOW-6124044:
    - '*':
        reason: >-
          Vulnerability if streaming datasets from a web server, allowing them
          to write to a directory outside of the current directory. Streaming
          datasets from the web with mlflow is not allowed, and writing to a
          directory is a relatively minor vulnerability. Exception approved via
          Slack huddle between Andreas and Martin on 2023-12-14.
