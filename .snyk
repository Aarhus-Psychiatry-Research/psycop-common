  SNYK-PYTHON-IPYTHON-3318382:
    - '*':
        reason: >-
          Required for deepchecks, which validates our data. The vulnerability
          requires local access at the same time as code is being run. Since all
          users with local access to Ovartaci are already admins, this does not
          introduce any further vulnerability.

  SNYK-PYTHON-JUPYTERSERVER-5862882:
    - '*':
        reason: >-
          Required for deepchecks, which validates our data. The vulnerability
          could redirect a login to jupyter server (which we do not use) to an
          outside site (which would be blocked on Ovartaci). This does not
          introduce any further vulnerability.

  SNYK-PYTHON-JUPYTERSERVER-5862881:
    - '*':
        reason: Required for deepchecks, which validates our data. The vulnerability
          could expose data to other local users _on the same server_ when opening untrusted files via the "Open image in new tab." function in jupyter server, (which we do not use). Since all
          users with local access to Ovartaci are already admins, this does not
          introduce any further vulnerability.
