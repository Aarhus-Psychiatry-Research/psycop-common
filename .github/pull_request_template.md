- [ ] I have battle-tested on Overtaci (RMAPPS1279)
- [ ] I have assigned ranges (e.g. `>=0.1, <0.2`) to all new dependencies (allows dependabot to keep dependency ranges wide for better compatability)
- [ ] At least one of the commits is prefixed with either "fix:" or "feat:"

## Notes for reviewers
Reviewers can skip X, but should pay attention to Y.
