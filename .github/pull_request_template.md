Reviews go much faster if the reviewer knows what to focus on! Help them out, e.g.:
Reviewers can skip X, but should pay attention to Y.

Remember to prioritise safety in your review. Make sure the following points have been covered:
[] New packages have been vetted
[] Only aggregate data is saved to disk
[] Comments or examples do not contain actual data
[] The code does not log sensitive information
