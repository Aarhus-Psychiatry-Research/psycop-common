## Logging Altair to WandB
Minimal example
```py
run = wandb.init()

source = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "a": ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I"],
        "b": [28, 55, 43, 91, 81, 53, 19, 87, 52],
    }
)

chart = alt.Chart(source).mark_bar().encode(x="a", y="b")

tmp_filename = "chart.png"
chart.save(tmp_filename)

run.log({"dummy_chart" : wandb.Image(tmp_filename)})
```
